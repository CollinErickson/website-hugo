I am writing this because I forget myself how to do this.
I set up this blog through GitHub following
[the instructions provided by Robert Myles](http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/).
Now when I want to make a new post I do the following

## 1. Opened RStudio to my website-hugo project.

## 2. Create a new post

The posts are created and built using the R package blogdown.
To create the new post, I use
`blogdown::new_post(title='<insert post name here>', ext='.Rmd')`.
Using `ext='.Rmd'` makes it a .Rmd file instead of a .md file.
This argument used to be `rmd=T`, but was changed sometime in the last 4 months.
