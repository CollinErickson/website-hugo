I am writing this because I forget myself how to do this.
I set up this blog through GitHub following
[the instructions provided by Robert Myles](http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/).
Now when I want to make a new post I do the following

## 1. Opened RStudio to my website-hugo project.

## 2. Create a new post

The posts are created and built using the R package blogdown.
To create the new post, I use
`blogdown::new_post(title='<insert post name here>', ext='.Rmd')`.
Using `ext='.Rmd'` makes it a .Rmd file instead of a .md file.
This argument used to be `rmd=T`, but was changed sometime in the last 4 months.

## 3. Serve site

Use `blogdown::serve_site()` to evaluate the .Rmd file and make it a .html file.

Do not use `blogdown::build_site()`.
This will rebuild all previous posts, too,
which is not wanted.
This was especially bad since I no longer had my TensorFlow working, so it failed.

## 4. Commit files to Git

## 5. Commit public folder to Git

This part is a little bit complicated,
or at least it is usually what causes me trouble.
I use GitKraken to manage my Git repositories.
In GitKraken I have to open the public folder and commit all the changes.
This copies the changes over to my github.io Git project,
which makes it show up on my blog.
