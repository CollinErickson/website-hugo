<p>A while back I tried to set up a GitHub blog following instructions using Jekyll and Ruby, which seems to be the recommended method by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">GitHub</a>. I had lots of trouble following tutorials and getting it to work, and eventually abandoned it.</p>
<p>Recently I tried again, after finding out that I can do it through RStudio, using the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>. I followed the instructions provided by <a href="http://robertmyles.github.io/2017/02/01/how-to-make-a-github-pages-blog-with-rstudio-and-hugo/">Robert Myles</a>, and it seems to be working fine so far. This is much better for me, seeing as I am a heavy RStudio user. I still need to get it personalized and put something useful on here, but Iâ€™ve completed the hardest part.</p>
<p>If you are an R user you should be using Rmarkdown to create documents with R code embedded, and you should use blogdown to create your blog posts since it makes the entire process very easy.</p>
