<p>One of the main reasons I strongly prefer R to Python is that
RStudio is far better than all Python IDEs I have used.
I usually use Spyder for my Python IDE, but it has a lot
of shortcomings compared to RStudio.</p>
<p>RStudio has added some Python support, for example in Rmarkdown
files, in the past.
Recently I discovered the R package reticulate which is closely
integrated with RStudio and lets you run Python code more easily
in RStudio.
<a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/03/26/reticulate-r-interface-to-python/">This blog post</a>
gives a great overview of how it works with examples.
I’m going to go through some of the highlights here
to give it a test run.</p>
<div id="enhanced-rmarkdown-with-python-chunks" class="section level2">
<h2>Enhanced RMarkdown with Python chunks</h2>
<p>R Markdown files have allowed Python before,
but now variables from these chunks can be accessed
in following chunks using <code>py$&lt;variable name&gt;</code>.
Similarly, Python code can access R variables
using <code>r.&lt;variable name&gt;</code>.
This is especially handy when you have certain tasks
or functions that are already coded in one language
but you want to use the results in the other.</p>
</div>
<div id="shared-objects-between-python-and-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Shared objects between Python and R</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you can access Python variables in
R using <code>py$&lt;variable name&gt;</code> and R variables in python
using <code>r.&lt;variable name&gt;</code>.
Here’s an example, I’ve noted whether the code chunks are
in R or Python.</p>
<p>(in R)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
a &lt;- 123</code></pre>
<p>(in Python)</p>
<pre class="python"><code>x = 456
print(x + r.a)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 579.0</code></pre>
<p>(in R)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>py$x + a</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 579</code></pre>
<p>You can even pass data frames between them.
The Python equivalent of a data frame is a
Pandas data frame.</p>
<p>(in R)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3), b=c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>(in Python)</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(r.df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      a  b
## 0  1.0  a
## 1  2.0  b
## 2  3.0  c</code></pre>
<p>(in Python)</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(type(r.df))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="running-a-python-session-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Running a Python session in R</h2>
<p>If you call <code>reticulate::repl_python()</code>, a Python session begins
within the console.
Typing <code>exit</code> will quit the session.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">alt text</p>
</div>
<p>This doesn’t seem useful at first, but you can share variables between
R and Python as shown above.
Thus if you have code or libraries that you need in both R and Python,
it should be easier to pass the data between them rather than writing
the data to file and reading it back in.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reticulate gives some cool capabilities for mixing R and Python.
While this is useful when you have code in R and Python you want
to mix, RStudio is not a replacement for a Python IDE,
and likely won’t ever since it is focused on R.
The lack of text highlighting or autosuggest for Python files in RStudio
are two major deficiencies, both of which seem like easy problems
to solve, though, so it isn’t too farfetched.</p>
