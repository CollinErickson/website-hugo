One of the main reasons I strongly prefer R to Python is that 
RStudio is far better than all Python IDEs I have used.
I usually use Spyder for my Python IDE, but it has a lot
of shortcomings compared to RStudio.

RStudio has added some Python support, for example in Rmarkdown
files in the past.
This week I discovered the R package reticulate which is closely
integrated with RStudio and lets you run Python code more easily
in RStudio.
[This blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/03/26/reticulate-r-interface-to-python/)
gives a great overview of how it works with examples.

## Examples

### Shared objects between Python and R

Run py$ and r.

### Running a Python session in R

If you call run `reticulate::repl_python()`

```{r}
getwd()
```



### Enhanced RMarkdown with Python chunks

R Markdown files have allowed Python before,
but now variables from these chunks can be accessed
in following chunks using `py$<variable name>`.
Similarly, Python code can access R variables 
using `r.<variable name`.
This is especially handy when you have certain tasks
or functions that are already coded in one language
but you want to use the results in the other.

## Summary/opinion

When I have two Python chunks in an Rmarkdown file, the variables are
shared between them as expected.
But if I try to run the cells one at a time in RStudio,
the second chunk won't have variables from the first chunk.

RStudio does not work well currently as a Python IDE,
and likely won't ever since its focus is on R.
The lack of text highlighting or autosuggest for Python files in RStudio
are two major deficiencies, both of which seem like easy problems
to solve.
