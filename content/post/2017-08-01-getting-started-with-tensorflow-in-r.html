<p>I have installed TensorFlow on my Windows laptop, and it appears to work using Python. I’m a heavy R user, so I’d like to be able to run TensorFlow through R (and RStudio).</p>
<p>First I installed the <code>tensorflow</code> library</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&#39;tensorflow&#39;)
library(tensorflow)</code></pre>
<p>This warned me that my version of R wasn’t up to date. I updated R to 3.4.1 and RStudio to 1.0.153 to make sure that everything is the current version.</p>
<p>Now to get TensorFlow working I will follow the instructions on <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/" class="uri">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tensorflow)
sess = tf$Session()
hello &lt;- tf$constant(&#39;Hello, TensorFlow!&#39;)
sess$run(hello)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## b&#39;Hello, TensorFlow!&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it works fine, very simple so far.</p>
<div id="running-an-example" class="section level3">
<h3>Running an example</h3>
<p>I’m going to try to get the MNIST example to work found at <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorial_mnist_pros.html" class="uri">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorial_mnist_pros.html</a>. First we load the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tensorflow)
input_dataset &lt;- tf$examples$tutorials$mnist$input_data
mnist &lt;- input_dataset$read_data_sets(&quot;MNIST-data&quot;, one_hot = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Looks like the data loads fine.</p>
<p>Now we start a session. I don’t know why they have the <code>library</code> command again, but I’ll play along.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tensorflow)
sess &lt;- tf$InteractiveSession()</code></pre>
<p>Next we create the placeholders for the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- tf$placeholder(tf$float32, shape(NULL, 784L))
y_ &lt;- tf$placeholder(tf$float32, shape(NULL, 10L))</code></pre>
<p>And next the variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>W &lt;- tf$Variable(tf$zeros(shape(784L, 10L)))
b &lt;- tf$Variable(tf$zeros(shape(10L)))</code></pre>
<p>We initialize these variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a simple regression model. A single layer with a softmax.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>y &lt;- tf$nn$softmax(tf$matmul(x,W) + b)</code></pre>
<p>And use cross-entropy for the loss function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cross_entropy &lt;- tf$reduce_mean(-tf$reduce_sum(y_ * tf$log(y), reduction_indices=1L))</code></pre>
<p>We specify how to train the model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>optimizer &lt;- tf$train$GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5)
train_step &lt;- optimizer$minimize(cross_entropy)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can train the model with the following for loop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:1000) {
  batches &lt;- mnist$train$next_batch(100L)
  batch_xs &lt;- batches[[1]]
  batch_ys &lt;- batches[[2]]
  sess$run(train_step,
           feed_dict = dict(x = batch_xs, y_ = batch_ys))
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see how the model does by checking its predictions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>correct_prediction &lt;- tf$equal(tf$argmax(y, 1L), tf$argmax(y_, 1L))</code></pre>
<p>We check the accuracy with the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accuracy &lt;- tf$reduce_mean(tf$cast(correct_prediction, tf$float32))
accuracy$eval(feed_dict=dict(x = mnist$test$images, y_ = mnist$test$labels))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.9204</code></pre>
<p>That simple model was able to classify over 91% of the digits correctly, a hair less than the example online, but still very good for such a simple model.</p>
</div>
<div id="multilayer-convnet" class="section level2">
<h2>Multilayer ConvNet</h2>
<p>Now we try to more advanced model to improve the results. Convolution neural networks are very popular for image recognition. Seeing as object recognition networks can get very high accuracies, we should be able to get near perfect on such a simple task as digit recognition.</p>
<p>Initialize functions to create weight and bias variables</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weight_variable &lt;- function(shape) {
  initial &lt;- tf$truncated_normal(shape, stddev=0.1)
  tf$Variable(initial)
}

bias_variable &lt;- function(shape) {
  initial &lt;- tf$constant(0.1, shape=shape)
  tf$Variable(initial)
}</code></pre>
<p>Set up the convolutions and pooling.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>conv2d &lt;- function(x, W) {
  tf$nn$conv2d(x, W, strides=c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), padding=&#39;SAME&#39;)
}

max_pool_2x2 &lt;- function(x) {
  tf$nn$max_pool(
    x, 
    ksize=c(1L, 2L, 2L, 1L),
    strides=c(1L, 2L, 2L, 1L), 
    padding=&#39;SAME&#39;)
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we create the variables for the first layer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>W_conv1 &lt;- weight_variable(shape(5L, 5L, 1L, 32L))
b_conv1 &lt;- bias_variable(shape(32L))</code></pre>
<p>x must be reshaped from a vector of length 784 to a 28 by 28 square in order for the convolutions to work.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x_image &lt;- tf$reshape(x, shape(-1L, 28L, 28L, 1L))</code></pre>
<p>Next we apply the relu and pooling after multiplying x by the weight and adding the bias.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>h_conv1 &lt;- tf$nn$relu(conv2d(x_image, W_conv1) + b_conv1)
h_pool1 &lt;- max_pool_2x2(h_conv1)</code></pre>
<p>Now we add a second conv layer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>W_conv2 &lt;- weight_variable(shape = shape(5L, 5L, 32L, 64L))
b_conv2 &lt;- bias_variable(shape = shape(64L))

h_conv2 &lt;- tf$nn$relu(conv2d(h_pool1, W_conv2) + b_conv2)
h_pool2 &lt;- max_pool_2x2(h_conv2)</code></pre>
<p>And a fully connected layer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>W_fc1 &lt;- weight_variable(shape(7L * 7L * 64L, 1024L))
b_fc1 &lt;- bias_variable(shape(1024L))

h_pool2_flat &lt;- tf$reshape(h_pool2, shape(-1L, 7L * 7L * 64L))
h_fc1 &lt;- tf$nn$relu(tf$matmul(h_pool2_flat, W_fc1) + b_fc1)</code></pre>
<p>We use dropout to help regularize.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>keep_prob &lt;- tf$placeholder(tf$float32)
h_fc1_drop &lt;- tf$nn$dropout(h_fc1, keep_prob)</code></pre>
<p>And finally a softmax layer as output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>W_fc2 &lt;- weight_variable(shape(1024L, 10L))
b_fc2 &lt;- bias_variable(shape(10L))

y_conv &lt;- tf$nn$softmax(tf$matmul(h_fc1_drop, W_fc2) + b_fc2)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can run the training and optimization.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cross_entropy &lt;- tf$reduce_mean(-tf$reduce_sum(y_ * tf$log(y_conv), reduction_indices=1L))
train_step &lt;- tf$train$AdamOptimizer(1e-4)$minimize(cross_entropy)
correct_prediction &lt;- tf$equal(tf$argmax(y_conv, 1L), tf$argmax(y_, 1L))
accuracy &lt;- tf$reduce_mean(tf$cast(correct_prediction, tf$float32))
sess$run(tf$global_variables_initializer())

for (i in 1:20000) {
  batch &lt;- mnist$train$next_batch(50L)
  if (i %% 100 == 0) {
    train_accuracy &lt;- accuracy$eval(feed_dict = dict(
        x = batch[[1]], y_ = batch[[2]], keep_prob = 1.0))
    cat(sprintf(&quot;step %d, training accuracy %g\n&quot;, i, train_accuracy))
  }
  train_step$run(feed_dict = dict(
    x = batch[[1]], y_ = batch[[2]], keep_prob = 0.5))
}</code></pre>

<p>The default of 20000 steps was far too many. It had near perfect training predictions after 1500 and it took about an hour to train the full thing. When I changed it to 2000 iterations it had test accuracy of 97.7%.</p>
