I've heard about t-SNE recently in a few places,
but I have no clue how it works.
I'm going to give it a shot here and see if I can understand it.

t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that is often used to
visualize data from many dimensions in two or three dimensions.
Unlike PCA, t-SNE is a nonlinear technique for dimensionality
reduction.
The method uses similarity distributions in the full input space
and in the reduced dimension space.
It minimizes the difference between these two distributions
to create the best mapping into the lower dimensional subspace.

The mapping in low dimension space has parameters that are
estimated using stochastic gradient descent.
This can take a long time to run,
and will be much slower than PCA.

## Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Better results than PCA


Cons:
- Much slower than PCA
