I've heard about t-SNE recently in a few places,
but I have no clue how it works.
I'm going to give it a shot here and see if I can understand it.

t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that is often used to
visualize data from many dimensions in two or three dimensions.
Unlike PCA, t-SNE is a nonlinear technique for dimensionality
reduction.
The method uses similarity distributions in the full input space
and in the reduced dimension space.
It minimizes the difference between these two distributions
to create the best mapping into the lower dimensional subspace.
