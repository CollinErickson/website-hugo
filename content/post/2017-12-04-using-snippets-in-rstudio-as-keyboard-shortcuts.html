<p><a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets">Code Snippets</a> are a useful feature of RStudio that many people don’t know about. The RStudio Blog post gives good instructions on how they can be used, but I thought I’d share how I use them.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways I use snippets:</p>
<div id="loading-magrittr" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading Magrittr</h2>
<p>One of my favorite R functions is the pipe operator, <code>%&gt;%</code>, from the Magrittr package. There’s already a keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Shift+M, for this function. However, it’s really annoying when I first try to use it and I get the error message that the function could not be found. All that is required is to then call <code>library(magrittr)</code>, but that’s a lot of typing (not really, but it feels that way). So I created a snippet, <code>lbm</code>, to speed this up, shown below.</p>
<pre><code>snippet lbm
    library(magrittr)</code></pre>
<p>Now if I type <code>lbm</code>, then press tab, it inserts <code>library(magrittr)</code> for me.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-other-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading other packages</h2>
<p>Similar to Magrittr, there are other packages that I often need to load. So I can create a snippet in the exact same way as above (these two sections could really just be one section). Right now I have snippets to load testthat (<code>lbtt</code>) and three of my own packages: <code>lbcf</code> for ContourFunctions, <code>lbtf</code> for TestFunctions, and <code>lbgp</code> for GauPro.</p>
</div>
<div id="shortcuts-for-functions-with-long-names" class="section level2">
<h2>Shortcuts for functions with long names</h2>
<p>A similar way I use snippets are as shortcuts for functions with long names. I love the <code>microbenchmark</code> package and function, but it’s name, especially typing it when the package isn’t loaded, is far too long. I created a snippet, <code>mb</code>, that is much shorter. I also created another one, <code>mbc</code>, for the <code>mbc</code> function in my <code>comparer</code> package. Both are shown below.</p>
<pre><code>snippet mb
    microbenchmark::microbenchmark

snippet mbc
    comparer::mbc</code></pre>
</div>
