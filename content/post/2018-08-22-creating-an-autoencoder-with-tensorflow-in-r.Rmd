Once again I'm going to be trying something new,
and mainly just using this blog post to track it
for later reference.
This time I am going to implement an autoencoder,
and I'm going to use the R interface to TensorFlow
to do it.

## Data

I'm not going to use real data.
I'm just going to creating a function that will give a sequence
of numbers.
These will be fed into the network, with the goal being
to get the same thing out on the other side.

I'll just use values from a sine function.
Each training instance will have points generated
from a different set of parameters.
The parameters of a sine function are the phase,
frequency, and amplitude.

Here's what a single data instance will look like,
I'll evaluate the function at $0, \ldots, 100$.

```{r}
generate_instance <- function(x, phase, frequency, amplitude) {
  amplitude*sin(x*frequency-phase)
}
plot(generate_instance(0:100, 0, .1, 1.5))
```
