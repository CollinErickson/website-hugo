I had never heard of spectral clustering until last week.
Then I came across
[this image](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_001.png)
comparing 9 clustering algorithms on different 2D datasets.

It appeared to me that spectral clustering did the best across all the data,
and I realized that the only clustering algorithm I understood was k-means.
(DBSCAN might be better based on the results shown, but one step at a time.)
So here I'm going to try to figure out what spectral clustering is and how I can implement it.
