I had never heard of spectral clustering until last week.
Then I came across
[this image](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_001.png)
comparing 9 clustering algorithms on different 2D datasets.

It appeared to me that spectral clustering did the best across all the data,
and I realized that the only clustering algorithm I understood was k-means.
(DBSCAN might be better based on the results shown, but one step at a time.)
So here I'm going to try to figure out what spectral clustering is and how I can implement it.

## Create data

I'm going to create a dataset to have something to work with as I go.
I'm going to make it very easy.

```{r}
n <- 100
x1 <- matrix(rnorm(2*n), n, 2)
x2 <- sweep(matrix(rnorm(2*n), n, 2), 2, c(-5,0))
x <- rbind(cbind(x1,1), cbind(x2, 2))
x <- data.frame(x)
names(x)[3] <- "group"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=x, mapping=aes(x=X1, y=X2, color=group)) + geom_point()
```
