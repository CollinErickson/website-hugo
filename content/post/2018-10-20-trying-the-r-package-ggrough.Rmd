I recently came across the R package `ggrough` after seeing
[this tweet](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1050931390068547584)
while checking the #rstats topic on Twitter.
It makes plots that look like they were haphazardly sketched.
I figured I'd give it a try to see if I could get it to work.

You can find it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/xvrdm/ggrough).
The package is still in progress and has many problems.

## Set up

First you need to install `ggrough`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xvrdm/ggrough")
```

I also had to install showtext, which I also got from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("yixuan/showtext")
```

## Getting data

I'm going to try data other than was included in the
example on the GitHub page (`mtcars`).
I found the
[Ballarat pet dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ballarat-registered-dogs-cats/resource/96c5a6de-2f89-4cf5-9b90-159e5be97c31)
from the
[Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch).


```{r}
pets <- read.csv("https://data.gov.au/dataset/c916481b-6a03-45fb-a651-7d294e8fd6b8/resource/96c5a6de-2f89-4cf5-9b90-159e5be97c31/download/ballaratregisteredanimals.csv")
```

```{r}
str(pets)
```

## Using `ggrough`

Load the libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrough)
library(showtext)
```

First we make the plot with ggplot2.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=pets, mapping=aes(x=type)) + geom_bar()
p
```


So there's a simple bar chart.
Now we want to make it look rough.

```{r}
# ggRough part
options <- list(
  Background=list(roughness=12),
  GeomCol=list(fill_style="solid", bowing=0, roughness=6))
get_rough_chart(p, options, family = "Homemade Apple", font_size_booster = 1.45)
#get_rough_chart(p)
```

I can't get the image to show up in RStudio.
However, in the RStudio Viewer if I "Export -> Save as Web Page...",
then I can open the html file.
And it shows up after knitting with and viewing in my browser.

## Another plot

There's a warning on the `ggrough` web page that only one plot
will show up on each page.

```{r}
get_rough_chart(p + ggtitle("Second plot"), options, family = "Homemade Apple", font_size_booster = 1.45)

```
